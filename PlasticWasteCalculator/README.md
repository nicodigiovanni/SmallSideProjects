# Description
This simple Python application was made for a project in my Environmental Biology class in my Sophomore year at the University of Minnesota. We were tasked with creating anything ranging from a poem, song, presentaion, etc. and further inform the class on a Environmental subject we feel passionate about.  For my project, I chose to make a an application in Python that esitmates the amount of plastic waste that has entered the ocean since the the program was ran.

# How It was done
Using the tk GUI interface, I opened a new window that displays the amount of plastic in pounds that has "entered the ocean" since the application was ran. Additionally, there is a title and description to further inform the user. I utilized tk.lable in order to manipulate the text's font, size, and color in the window. For the "plastic counter", similar to how one would go about creating a digital clock, I created a global variable that is updated every 100 milliseconds using a formula I derived from data found on the US National Ocean Services webpage and set the variable to a tk.lable that appears on screen. Since the variable/label is updated so frequently, it appears as if the counter is continuously counting up.
